A brick breaker game I am currently working on.

The game is in it's early stages with only some basic features.

What the game can currently do:
                    
                   -the player can move the paddle left or right by pressing the left and right arrow keys or the a and d keys
                   
                   -the ball ricochets when hitting any game object or the invisible walls of the game
                   
                   -the bricks dissapear when the ball hits them
                   
                   -a game over screen will show up if the ball falls below the paddle which will let you replay
                   
                   -there is a settings button on the right corner of the screen but for now it can only pause/play the game
                    

Here are some screenshots on how the game currently looks.

The C# scripts can be found inside the assets directory.

In the future I am planing on making multiple levels, special bricks which will require more hits to be destroyed, special power ups which will spawn when destroying certain bricks, find better sprites, add some sound effects and polish the game so it would look and run more smoothly.
